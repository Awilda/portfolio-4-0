      <h3>Nice to meet you!</h3>
      <p>I'm a New York City based Web Developer but haven't always been a developer. I've worked in hospitals, theatres and retail stores yet somehow all that has led me here. It's a good thing I enjoy learning new things because what a journey it has been!</p>
      <p>In my free time, I enjoy cuddling with my fur-babies, reading, and  taking up a new gym class.</p> 
      <p>I hope to one day use my skills as a programmer to give back and contribute to the greater good.</p>
