      <span> I'm a Junior Front-End Developer from Miami, FL. I'm real passionate about tech, media and design. Working where all those three points meet is where I want to land. On my spare time, I love to adventure around the city or take some self-proclaimed professional photographs. I also love going to Ikea for no reason and playing obnoxiously loud music on my headphones. </span>
