      <span> Full name: Mirza Carolina de la Fuente, but call me Carolina! I'm a Junior Frontend Developer from Miami, currently working in Washington, DC as an Associate Instructor at The Iron Yard, a 12-week intensive coding bootcamp. I'm passionately curious about tech and design. Where those meet is where I want to land. In my spare time, I like to find new spots around town and drink lots of smoothies. </span>
